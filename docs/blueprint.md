## Core Features:

- Chat Interface: Implement a user-friendly chat interface for asking questions and receiving responses.
- Session Management: Allow users to clear the current document and associated chat history.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a vibrant sky blue (#4FC3F7) to evoke energy and clarity, suitable for a modern application focused on document interaction.
- Background color: Employ a soft, almost white, lavender (#F3E5F5) to add a touch of creativity while maintaining readability and a light aesthetic.
- Accent color: Introduce a lively coral (#FF7043) as a secondary color, mainly for interactive elements such as buttons or highlighted text. This provides a strong contrast and calls attention to important actions.
- Clean and modern font for text readability.
- Clean layout that clearly divides the document view panel, the chat box, and the controls.
- Employ subtle, smooth animations during transitions and data loading to enhance the user experience.
- Simple, clear icons for actions (upload, clear, etc.) to enhance usability.
